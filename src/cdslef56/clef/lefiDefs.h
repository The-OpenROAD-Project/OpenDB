/*
 * The memory policy controls how an object which refers to or is composed of
 * other objects manages those sub-objects, particularly when the parent
 * object is copied or deleted.  The policy is specified as an argument to
 * the constructor or initializer, and it is stored with the parent object.
 * 
 * The memory policy is a generalization of the common distinction between deep
 * and shallow copies.  When a shallow copy of a parent object is made, the
 * copy maintains pointers to the original sub-objects, and the original
 * parent remains responsible for deleting those sub-objects.  When a deep
 * copy of a parent object is made, the copy maintains pointers to new copies
 * of each of the sub-objects, and the copy is responsible for deleting the
 * new sub-objects.
 * 
 * The lefiPrivateSubObjects policy corresponds to a deep copy, while the the
 * lefiReferencedSubObjects policy corresponds to a shallow copy.  Usually an
 * initial parent object will be created using lefiPrivateSubObjects.  When a
 * copy is made of that parent object, the copy may either maintain its own
 * private versions of each sub-object, or it may refer to the original
 * sub-objects.
 * 
 * In certain cases, it is useful to create a deep copy of a parent object, even
 * though the new parent object shouldn't be responsible for the new
 * sub-objects.  In this case, the lefiOrphanSubObjects and
 * lefiAdoptedSubObjects policies may be used.  lefiOrphanSubObjects is
 * specified while creating the deep copy, and then lefiAdoptedSubObjects is
 * specified while creating another parent which will take on the
 * responsibility for the orphans.
 * 
 * An object's memory policy affects only the sub-objects which it directly
 * controls.  Those sub-objects themselves may have the same memory policy as
 * their parents, or they may have a different memory policy.  When a copy is
 * made of a child sub-object, the memory policy of the child controls
 * whether deep or shallow copies are made of the grandchildren.
